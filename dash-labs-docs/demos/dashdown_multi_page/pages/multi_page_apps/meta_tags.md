# Multi-Page Dash App Examples


### Example: Social Media Meta Tags
  
One of the nice features of this API is that it automatically creates the meta 
tags used by social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.  These sites use the app title, description and image to create
the card that is displayed when you share a link to your site. They are also used in search engine results.

Find more information on social media meta tags [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML)
You may also find [this article](https://css-tricks.com/essential-meta-tags-social-media/) helpful.

The example below goes into detail about how to add an image to a page in dash.page_registry and what
the meta tags look like.

See the code in `/demos/multi_page_meta_tags`

- `image`:
   The meta description image used by social media platforms.
   If not supplied, then it looks for the following images in `assets/`:
    - A page specific image: `assets/<title>.<extension>` is used, e.g. `assets/weekly_analytics.png`
    - A generic app image at `assets/app.<extension>`
    - A logo at `assets/logo.<extension>`

In the `assets` folder we have 4 jpeg images with the following file names:  
- app.jpeg
- birdhouse.jpeg
- birds.jpeg
- logo.jpeg

The `title` and `description` will be derrived from the module name if none is supplied.

In the `pages` folder we have 3 simple pages to demonstrate this feature. 

#### `a_page.py`

```python
import dash

dash.register_page(__name__)


def layout():
    return """    
    This page uses a generic image.  No image is specified and there is no image that matches
    the module name in the assets folder, so it uses `app.jpeg` or `logo.jpeg` if no `app.jpeg` exists.
    
    The title and description are not supplied, so they will be inferred from the module name. In this 
    case it will be "A page"
        """

```

#### `birds.py`
```python
import dash

dash.register_page(
    __name__,
    title="(birds) The title, headline or name of the page",
    description="(birds) A short description or summary 2-3 sentences",
)


def layout():
    return """
    No image is specified but it's inferred from the module name.
    The module name is`birds.py` so it uses the `birds.jpeg` file in the assets folder.
    """
```

#### `home.py`
```python
import dash
from dash import html

dash.register_page(
    __name__,
    path="/",
    image="birdhouse.jpeg",
    title="(home) The title, headline or name of the page",
    description="(home) A short description or summary 2-3 sentences",
)

layout = html.Div("The image for the home page is specified as `birdhouse.jpeg'")

```

The `dash.page_registry` now has an `image` for each page.  Note that you don't need to use the image in the app page
for it to be included in the meta tags.  You can see this by inspecting the page when you run the examples in chapter 8.

Below is the `app.py` we use as the entry point to run the app. If you'd like to see the app with Dash Bootstrap 
styling, make sure to execute the app_dbc.py file instead of the app.py file. 

Here is `app.py`:

```python
from dash import Dash, html, dcc
import dash
import dash_labs as dl

app = Dash(__name__, plugins=[dl.plugins.pages])


app.layout = html.Div(
    [
        html.H1("App Frame"),
        html.Div(
            [
                html.Div(
                    [
                        html.Img(
                            src=app.get_asset_url(page["image"]),
                            height="40px",
                            width="60px",
                        ),
                        dcc.Link(f"{page['name']} - {page['path']}", href=page["path"]),
                    ],
                    style={"margin": 20},
                )
                for page in dash.page_registry.values()                
            ]
        ),
        dl.plugins.page_container,
    ]
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)

```

If you inspect the page, you will see the Twitter Data card and the Open Graph data (which is use by Facebook) has
automatically been added to the page.

Note that the title and description are as specified for each app in the `pages` folder.  To see this open a new web page
for `http://127.0.0.1:8050/a-page`
